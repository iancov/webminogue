        <p class="special">Hello Flop!</p>
        <p>First things first, I'm the realest. Drop this and let the whole world feel it. And I'm still in the murda bizness I could hold you down, like I'm giving lessons in physics, what what. You should want a bad bitch like this. Drop it low and pick it up just like this. Cuppa Ace, cuppa Goose, cuppa Cris. High heels, something worth a half a ticket on my wrist ayy.</p>
       
        <p>Smart money bettin I'll be better off without you. In no time I'll be forgettin' all about you, you sayin' that you know but I already doubt you understand, my life is easy when I ain't around you! Iggy iggy too biggy to be here stressin. I'm thinking I love the thought of you more than I love your presence. And the best thing now is probly for you exit, I let you go, let you back. I finally learn my lesson.</p>
