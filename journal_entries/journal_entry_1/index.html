            “My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?”

            I thought this was a lovely read about the state of websites and what it means to create one on your own. One of the primary things I was thinking about before starting this class was whether or not I would be able to create a website that felt “worthy” or “important” enough. I also struggle with this when it comes to making print publications, or uploading something to Instagram. It is hard to feel valuable when making work in a system that does not value small, earnest creations all of the time. I appreciate the reframed thinking of websites as ever-changing, shifting places of our own creation. I also think it is interesting when a medium such as the web changes so much so rapidly. We are already mentioning “the way things were,” and we're really just talking about the past 20 years. I try to keep this in mind whenever I am upset at the state of things, or a current trend. What is really changing? And from what? To what? I find it always important to zoom out a bit.
