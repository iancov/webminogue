            This was perhaps my favorite of the assigned readings so far. I found the comparison between computation and other perceived “natural” facets of human life to be very impactful. I have been thinking a lot about the similarities between technology and otherwise “analog” life, and how I don't think the two need to be considered completely different all of the time. I think I've already brought this up in the past responses, but humans invented technology, so it's still a part of us (right?)

            I think the conversation around the business side and militarization of computers is also hugely important. Pretty much the entire marketing angle of computers has been that they are machines which are separate from you, that can do anything for you, without you having to know how or understand why. I think this has it's benefits (I love mysterious helpful tech like Shazam), but I also think it would be better if we all had a bit more discernment and understanding about why these things are marketed in this way. The less you know about how something functions, the more you rely on other people to fix things, sell you more things, and use your data/info without your awareness. There's a reason that Apple devices are so opaque in their operating, it drives customers to go back to Apple and Apple only for support or new devices.

            On a lighter note, I also really enjoyed the drawings/paintings included in the PDF, as scanned drawings are something I also have been including more and more in my design work.
